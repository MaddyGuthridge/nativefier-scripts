# Non-functional dark mode integration

An attempt to get dark mode stuff working.

It didn't work since I couldn't figure out a way around the content security
policy (see
[this GitHub comment](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/968#issuecomment-1043946155))

## Instead

I have a half-baked alternative in `badDark.css` which is injected. I yoinked
it from [this comment](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier/issues/968#issuecomment-1044822786)
